### Hey! I'm Chris! 👋

I have always loved technology across multiple fields of engineering and see the benefits these technologies can bring to help make things easier, improve consistency and quality, and positively impact quality of life.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering after much debate between Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Science.  I have worked 9 years in Pharmaceutical and Medical Device manufacturing, designing and implementing automated equipment and continuous improvements activities. My most recent position was as an engineering manager, helping to lead technological development and advancements within our facility and company.

The things I have enjoyed most about my career so far have been:

 programming and optimizing PLCs, vision systems, and human-machine interfaces to do things better, faster, and more cost effective
implementing new projects that remove business headaches and support customers' goals
developing methods for data collection that provides useful information to users and decision makers within an organization
Many of these skills were self-taught, as I have a strong desire to continuously improve my skills, add value to my team, and learn new, ever improving technologies.

Wanting to focus on the aspects of my career that I enjoy most, I joined the Flatiron School - Software Engineering program and graduated in December 2022. As a recent graduate of Flatiron School, with experience using front-end and back-end technologies such as Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and React, I wish to use and continue to develop these skills to make a positive impact to software project teams, businesses, and society.

I have strong and diverse analytical skills, project and management skills, and communication skills working with customers, engineers, managers, directors, and corporate leaders. I have always provide a very positive impact to teams and businesses and know that I can be an asset to yours!
